    "## Task 1: Bayes' Rule\n",
    "A light bulb manufactured by the General Illumination Company has an exponentially distributed lifetime $ Y $. However, the company has quality control issues. On any given day, the parameter $ \\lambda $ of the PDF of $ Y $ is actually a random variable uniformly distributed on the interval $[0, 1/2]$. We test a bulb and record the experimental lifetime $ y $. What can we infer about the underlying parameter $ \\lambda $?\n",
    "\n",
    "We model the parameter $ \\lambda $ as a random variable $ X $, which is uniformly distributed. All available information about $ X $ is contained in the conditional PDF $ f_{X|Y}(x|y) $. We treat $ y $ as a constant (equal to the observed value of $ Y $) and focus on the dependency of the PDF on $ x $. Note that $ f_X(x) = 2 $, for $ 0 \\leq x \\leq 1/2 $.\n",

    "In some cases, the unobserved phenomenon is inherently discrete. For example, if a binary signal is observed in the presence of normally distributed noise, or if a medical diagnosis is made based on continuous measurements like temperature and blood levels. In such cases, a slightly different version of Bayes' Rule applies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ X $ be a discrete random variable taking values in a finite set $\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$, representing the different discrete possibilities for the unobserved phenomenon of interest. The probability mass function (PMF) $ p_X(x) $ of $ X $ is assumed to be known. Let $ Y $ be a continuous random variable, described for each given value $ x $ by a conditional density function $ f_{Y|X}(y|x) $. We are interested in the conditional PMF of $ X $, given the observed value $ y $ of $ Y $.\n",
