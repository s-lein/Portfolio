    "## Task 1: Buffon's Needle Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Buffon's Needle Problem is a classic probability problem formulated by the French mathematician Georges-Louis Leclerc de Buffon in the 18th century. It involves dropping a needle randomly onto a plane marked with parallel lines at equal distances $ t $ and calculating\n",
    "\n",
    " the probability that the needle crosses one of the lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the following conditions:\n",
    "- Length of the needle: $ L $\n",
    "- Distance between the parallel lines: $ t $\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Formulate the probability that the needle crosses one of the lines as a function of $ L $ and $ t $.**\n",
    "2. **How does the probability change if the needle length $ L $ equals the distance $ t $?**\n",
    "3. **Implement a Monte Carlo algorithm to numerically determine the probability.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution:\n",

    "1. **Probability**:\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that a needle crosses one of the lines is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P = \\frac{2L}{t\\pi}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ L $ is the length of the needle and $ t $ is the distance between the lines. This formula holds when $ L \\leq t $. If $ L > t $, the calculation is more complex, but we focus here on the case $ L \\leq t $.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Special case: $ L = t $**:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the needle length equals the distance between the lines, i.e., $ L = t $, then the probability becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "P = \\frac{2t}{t\\pi} = \\frac{2}{\\pi} \\approx 0.6366\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that in about 63.66% of cases, the needle will cross one of the lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Monte Carlo Algorithm to Numerically Determine the Probability**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Monte Carlo approach is well-suited to numerically determine the probability. Here is a Python script that performs this simulation:"
